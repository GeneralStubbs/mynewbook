# Sample Book with Visualizations

the main goal with this book is to create a Jupyter Book with some minimal dependencies that I can run on my Mac and Windows laptop.


## Mac Environment

I installed pyenv using installer from [here]().
Created venv jupyter-book and installed mermaid and altair.

## GitHub pages

Secondly I'll create an action that will build and deploy these pages to my Github Pages.s
