# Sample Book with Visualizations

the main goal with this book is to create a Jupyter Book with some minimal dependencies that I can run on my Mac and Windows laptop.


## Mac Environment

I followed this [article](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#virtual-environments-and-pyenv
) installed pyenv using installer.

I then created a virtual environment, installed jupyter-book and installed mermaid and altair.

## GitHub pages

Secondly I'll create an action that will build and deploy these pages to my Github Pages.

This [reference](https://github.com/GeneralStubbs/jupyter-book-tutorial) has a lot of basic steps, but it seems that it is outdated.
The [Jupyter Book Documentation Section](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/publish/gh-pages.html?highlight=github#automatically-host-your-book-with-github-actions) links to a [sample repo](https://github.com/executablebooks/github-action-demo) as well as documents the github actions needed.
